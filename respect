The code you provided is a PHP script, so you will need to have PHP installed on your server in order to run it. You can download PHP from the official website: https://www.php.net/downloads. Once you have PHP installed, you can create a new file called `index.php` and copy the code you provided into it. Then, you can open the file in a web browser to see the forum.

If you are using a shared hosting account, your hosting provider may have already installed PHP for you. You can check with your hosting provider's documentation to find out for sure.

If you are running PHP on your own server, you will need to make sure that the `mysqli` extension is enabled.


The `mysqli` extension is used to connect to MySQL databases. You can enable the `mysqli` extension by adding the following line to your `php.ini` file:


​
extension=mysqli.so
​


Once you have enabled the `mysqli` extension, you can restart your web server and then try running the code again.
